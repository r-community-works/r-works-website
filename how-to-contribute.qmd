We hope R Works will attract other voices from around the R Community, including yourself! We're always looking for high-quality, original work to demonstrate the power of R. If you would like to contribute R-related topics, news, commentary, or examples, please follow this process to submit a post for consideration.

### Process for Contributing

* **Submit a post/idea:** Start the process by emailing us at [rworks.editors@gmail.com](mailto:rworks.editors@gmail.com).
* **Preliminary review:** Within two weeks, the R Works editors will review your submission and let you know the next steps.
  * We may let you know that the post is ready almost as-in, provide feedback for revisions to post on R Works, or recommend another avenue for your post if there is a better option.
* **Revisions:** We work together to revise the post.
* **Finalization:** We both confirm that the post is finalized and coordinate a timeline for release.
* **Publication:** We release the post based on the timeline and coordinate social media efforts to publicize the post.
