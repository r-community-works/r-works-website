  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Here’s another puzzle from Henry Dudeney’s article “The World’s Best Puzzles,” <em>The Strand Magazine</em>, December 1908. According to Dudeney, this puzzle is originally from <em>Problèmes plaisans et délectables qui se font par les nombres</em> (Pleasant and delectable number problems), by French mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Gaspar_Bachet_de_M%C3%A9ziriac">Claude Gaspar Bachet de Méziriac</a> (1851-1636).<sup>1</sup></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You have four (integral) weights <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_1,%20w_2,%20w_3,%20w_4"> and a balance scale such that you can weigh any (integral) number of pounds from 1 lb to 40 lbs. The weights may go on either side of the scale (e.g., with the object or in the opposite pan). What are the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_i">?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like a variation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_problem">Frobenius coin problem</a>, which, in general, is NP-hard. Fortunately, this specific instance is not.</p>
<p>As before, here’s Chirico’s <em>The Mathematicians</em> for you to look at while you try to solve this. Solution below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>The four weights are (1, 3, 9, 27). Before we confirm this computationally, let’s compute the solution using induction.</p>
<p>Let’s rephrase the problem as</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You have <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> weights… such that you can weigh any number of pounds in the range <code>1:m</code>….”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> depends on how many weights you have. We can also observe that the sum of all the weights must equal the weight of the heaviest object you can measure, and that object must weigh <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m"> pounds.</p>
<p>Then, for the case <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20=%201">, you have a single weight <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_1%20=%201">, and you can weigh any object that weighs one pound (the interval 1:1). Now let’s look at the case <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=2">.</p>
<section id="the-weights-w_1-1-w_2-3-can-weigh-any-object-from-1-to-4-pounds." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-weights-w_1-1-w_2-3-can-weigh-any-object-from-1-to-4-pounds.">1. The weights <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(w_1%20=%201,%20w_2%20=%203)"> can weigh any object from 1 to 4 pounds.</h3>
<p>I’ll use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> to denote the object to be weighed, and the notation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5C%7Bset_1%5C%7D%20%7C%20%5C%7Bset_2%5C%7D%5D"> to denote what’s on the left and the right side of the scale. I’ll always put <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> in the right-hand pan.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20=%201"></strong> is weighed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5C%7B1%5C%7D%20%7C%20%5C%7Bx%5C%7D%5D">. This can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20=%20x">.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20=%202"></strong> is weighed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5C%7B3%5C%7D%20%7C%20%5C%7Bx,%201%5C%7D%5D">. This can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20=%20x%20+%201">, or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20-%201%20=%20x">.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20=%203"></strong> is weighed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5C%7B3%5C%7D%20%7C%20%5C%7Bx%5C%7D%5D">. This can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%20=%20x">.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20=%204"></strong> is weighed as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B%5C%7B1,%203%5C%7D%20%7C%20%5C%7Bx%5C%7D%5D">. This can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20+%203%20=%20x">.</p>
<p>You can see from the above that the general form of the solution is</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0As_1%20w_1%20+%20s_2%20w_2%20=%20x%0A"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(w_1,%20w_2)%20=%20(1,%203)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_1%20%5Cin%20%5C%7B-1,%200,%201%5C%7D">. A positive coefficient means the weight is in the left pan, a negative one means it’s in the right pan, and zero means the weight isn’t used. This is essentially a “signed trinary” representation of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">. For two digits, signed trinary can represent <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5E2%20=%209"> values.</p>
<p>Let’s just see what that looks like in R:</p>

<p>You can confirm for yourself that using another pair of weights won’t necessarily give you 9 unique values.</p>
<p>We are only interested in the positive values for our problem. We can calculate that the number of positive values is</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A(3%5E2%20-%201)/2%20=%20(9%20-%201)/2%20=%204.%0A"></p>
<p>In other words, the weights (1, 3) can weigh the values <code>1:4</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-case-of-three-weights" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-case-of-three-weights">2. The case of three weights</h3>
<p>How many values can we weigh with three weights, and what are they? It’s clear that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_1"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_2"> must be the same as above, since any value in the range <code>1:4</code> can be represented as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?s_1%20*%201%20+%20s_2%20*%203%20+%200%20*%20w_3">. Now to find <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_3">.</p>
<p>We know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5E3%20=%2027">, which means that we can represent <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(27%20-%201)/2%20=%2013"> positive values, with 13 being the maximum. So the three weights must sum to 13, which gives us <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_3%20=%2013%20-%20(1%20+%203)%20=%209">. The set of weights is (1, 3, 9).</p>

<section id="finally-the-case-of-four-weights" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finally-the-case-of-four-weights">3. Finally, the case of four weights</h3>
<p>We can calculate that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5E4%20=%2081">, which corresponds to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(81%20-%201)/2%20=%2040"> positive values (surprise!). Therefore, we have that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w_4%20=%2040%20-%20(1%20+%203%20+%209)%20=%2027">. And so the set of weights we want is (1, 3, 9, 27), as stated above.</p>

  <title>Examining Meta-Analysis</title>

  <link>https://rworks.dev/posts/meta-analysis/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In this post, we would like to review the idea of <em>meta-analysis</em> and compare a traditional, frequentist style, random effects meta-analysis to Bayesian methods. We will do this using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=meta">meta</a> R package and a Bayesian analysis conducted with R but actually carried out by the <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> programming language on the back end. We will use a small but interesting textbook data set of summary data from eight randomized controlled trials. These studies examined the effectiveness of the calcium channel blocker Amlodipine compared to a placebo in improving work capacity in patients with angina. The data set and the analysis with the <code>meta</code> package come directly from the textbook by <span class="citation" data-cites="appliedmetawithR">Chen and Peace (2013)</span>. Although there are several R packages that are capable of doing the Bayesian meta-analysis, we chose to work in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan">rstan</a> to demonstrate its flexibility and hint how one might go about doing a large complex study that doesn’t quite fit with pre-programmed paradigms.</p>
<p>To follow our examples, you really don’t need to know much more about meta-analysis than the definition offered by <span class="citation" data-cites="enwiki:1251112044">Wikipedia contributors (2024)</span>: “meta-analysis is a method of synthesis of quantitative data from multiple independent studies addressing a common research question”. If you want to dig deeper, a good overview of the goals and terminology can be found in <span class="citation" data-cites="doi:10.2519/jospt.2011.3333">Israel and Richter (2011)</span>. The online textbook <a href="https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/">Doing Meta-Analysis in R: A Hands-on Guide</a> by <span class="citation" data-cites="doingmetawithR">Mathias Harrier and Ebert (2021)</span> will take you a long way in performing your own work.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-pooling">Naive Pooling</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)">statistically inefficient</a>, naive technique to combine the studies would be to pool all of the data. This is usually not even possible, as most studies don’t share data — and at best share summaries. We might hope this is enough to get a good estimate of the expected difference between treatment and non-treatment. However this ignores variance and treats low-quality results on the same footing as high-quality results, yielding unreliable results. Naive pooling also lacks standard diagnostic procedures and indications.</p>
<p>That being said, let’s form the naive pooled estimate.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-fixed-effects-model">A Fixed Effects Model</h2>
<p>Perhaps the simplest reliable analysis is the fixed effects model. The underlying assumption for the fixed-effects model is that the true underlying effect or difference between treatment and control, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta">, is the same for all studies in the meta-analysis and that all possible risk factors are the same for all studies. Each study has its own observed effect size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cdelta_i%7D">. However, each is assumed to be a noisy estimate of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta">.</p>

<p>The primary result of the summary is: the overall estimate for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta"> is <code>0.1619</code>, much smaller than the naive pooling estimate of <code>0.2013</code>. Also, a number of diagnostics seem “okay.” From the forest plot, it is easy to see that the Amlodipine treatment is not statistically significant for four of the protocols, but the overall effect of the difference between the treatment and the control is statistically significant. The plot also shows the test for heterogeneity, which indicates that there is no evidence against homogeneity.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-random-effects-model">A Random Effects Model</h2>
<p>The next level of modeling is a random effects model. In this style model, we admit that the studies may be, in fact, studying different populations and different effects. A perhaps cleaner way to think about this is not as a type of effect (fixed or random), but as a model structured as a hierarchy (<span class="citation" data-cites="Gelman_Hill_2006">Gelman and Hill (2006)</span>). The idea is that the analyst claims the populations are related, and the different effects are drawn from a common distribution, and observations are then drawn from these <em>unobserved</em> per-population effects. Inference is possible as the observed outcomes distributionally constrain the unobserved parameters.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption for the random-effects model is that each study has its own true underlying treatment effect, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta_i">, with variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7B%5Csigma_i%7D%5E2"> that is estimated by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Chat%7B%5Cdelta_i%7D"> Furthermore, all of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdelta_i"> follow a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N(%5Cdelta,%5Ctau%5E2)"> distribution.

<p>Some issues associated with the above analyses include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Limited control of the distributional assumptions. What if we wanted to assume specific distributions on the un-observed individual outcomes? What if we want to change assumptions for a sensitivity analysis?</li>
<li>The results are limited to point estimates of the distribution parameters.</li>
<li>The results may depend on the underlying assumption of Normal distributions of published summaries.</li>
<li>The reported significance is not necessarily the probability of positive effect for a new subject.</li>
</ol>
<section id="bayesian-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bayesian-analysis">Bayesian analysis</h3>
<p>To try and get direct control of the model, graphs, and the model explanation, we will perform a direct hierarchical analysis using Stan through the <code>rstan</code> package.</p>
<p>We want to estimate the unobserved true value of treatment effect by a meta-analysis of different studies. The challenges of meta-analysis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The studies may be of somewhat different populations, implying different mean and variance of treatment and control response.</li>
<li>We are working from summary data from the studies and not data on individual patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to make things simple for the analyst and ask only for approximate distributional assumptions on the individual respondents in terms of unknown, to-be-inferred parameters. Then we will use Stan to sample individual patient outcomes (and unobserved parameters) that are biased to be consistent with the known summaries. This saves having to know or assume distributions of the summary statistics. And, in fact, we could try individual distributions different from the “Normal” we plug in here.</p>
<p>The advantage of working this way is that the modeling assumptions are explicitly visible and controllable. The matching downside is that we have to own our modeling assumptions; we lose the anonymity of the implicit justification of invoking tradition and recognized authorities.</p>
<p>To get this to work, we use two Stan tricks or patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instantiate many intermediate variables (such as individual effects).</li>
<li>Simulate equality enforcement by saying a specified difference tends to be small.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, load the required packages.</p>

<p>The modeling principles are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are unobserved true treatment and control effects we want to estimate. Call these <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu%5E%7Btreatment%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu%5E%7Bcontrol%7D">. We assume a shared standard deviation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma">. We can easily model without a shared standard deviation by introducing more parameters to the model specification.</li>
<li>For each protocol or study, we have ideal unobserved mean treatment effects and mean control effects. Call these <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%7Bi%7D%5E%7Btreatment%7D"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%7Bi%7D%5E%7Bcontrol%7D"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%20=%201%20%5Ccdots%208">.</li>
</ul>
<p>The equations bringing each study <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i"> into our Bayesian model are as follows.</p>

<p>The above equations are designed to be argued over. They need to be believed to relate the unobserved true treatment and control effects to the recorded study summaries. If they are not believed, is there a correction that would fix that? If the equations are good enough, then we can sample the implied posterior distribution of the unknown true treatment and control effects, which would finish the meta-analysis. The driving idea is that it may be easier to discuss how unobserved individual measurements may relate to observed and unobserved summaries and parameters than to work out how to relate statistical summaries to statistical summaries.</p>
<p>It is mechanical to translate the above relations into a Stan source model to make the desired inferences. The lines marked “force inferred to be near observed” are not distributional beliefs- but just a tool for enforcing that the inferred individual data should match the claimed summary statistics.</p>

<p>This code runs the procedure. The function <code>run_cache()</code> runs the standard <code>stan()</code> function, saving the result to a file cache for quick and deterministic re-re-renderings of the notebook. The caching is not required, but the runs took about five minutes on an old-Intel based Mac.</p>

<p>And our new estimate is: 0.1611715 which is very similar to the previous results. We can graph the inferred posterior distribution of effect size as follows.</p>
<p>First, we plot the estimated posterior distribution of both the treatment and control effects. This is the final result of the analysis, using all of the data, simulated from the eight trials. In this result, high-variance studies have a diminished influence on the overall estimated effect sizes. Running all of the simulated data together without maintaining the trial structure would produce an inflated <code>0.2</code> again.</p>

<p>Then, we can plot the compared inferences of the hierarchical and independent models.</p>
<p>The top plot shows the Bayesian inference that would result using only data from a single study. The bottom plot shows the estimate made for the given study, given the data from the other studies. Notice that in this first pair of plots, the bottom plot sharpens the distributions and tends to pull the means together. The first two plots have the means pulled in, the third pushed out, and behavior varies by group from then on. Notice in Protocol 162, the inferred means are reversed. These graphs are the Bayesian analogs of the forest plots above.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is a challenge to communicate exactly <em>what</em> meta-analysis a given standard package actually implements. It is our assumption that many standard meta-analyses reflect the tools available to the researchers and do not necessarily provide the ability to implement distributions that reflect the modeling assumptions they would prefer. Or, to be blunt, you don’t really know what the packaged models are doing until you can match them to a known calculation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest difference between the “standard” and Bayesian approaches is that Bayesian modeling requires the analyst to really <em>own</em> the modeling assumptions. This is why we wrote out so many of the modeling distributional assumptions as formulas instead of as named methodologies in our method descriptions.</p>
<p>We feel that there is a gap in the available practical literature. There is room for more teaching materials making meta-analysis more approachable by relating them to explicit model structures.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Nina Zumel presented the “100 Bushels of Corn” puzzle <a href="https://rworks.dev/posts/100bushels/">here</a> as a fun example of using R as a calculator. What if we want R to solve the puzzle for us, instead of merely being a calculator?</p>
<p>Let’s give that a go.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-the-problem">Setting Up the Problem</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>100 bushes of corn are distributed to 100 people such that every man receives 3 bushels, every woman 2 bushels, and every child 1/2 a bushel. How many men, women, and children are there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can write the 100 Bushels of Corn problem as finding integer vectors <code>x</code> that satisfy <code>a %*% x = b</code> for the following <code>a, b</code>. The first row specifies the constraint on the total number of men, women and children; the second row specifies the constraint on how many bushels each person gets. Notice that we doubled the values of the second equation to keep everything integral.</p>

<p>There are at least two main ways to solve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brute force. This is kind of the point of computers and programming languages.</li>
<li>Linear algebra, in particular linear algebra over the ring of integers. This approach shows some of the richness of the R package environment curated at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at these two solution styles.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ring-theory-solution">Ring Theory Solution</h2>
<p>It turns out there is a systematic way to find all of the integral solutions to a linear system quickly, at least for low dimensional solution spaces. To do this we will use a ring theory or linear algebra matrix factorization called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_normal_form">Hermite normal form</a>. Fortunately, R has a package for this, called <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=numbers">numbers</a>. We attach this package as follows.</p>

</div>
<p>This package will find for us a lower diagonal integer matrix <code>h</code> and a square unimodular matrix <code>u</code> such that <code>h = a %*% u</code>. Unimodular matrices map the space of integer vectors <code>Z<sup>n</sup></code> to the same space of integer vectors in a 1 to 1, onto, and invertible manner. This means finding integer solution vectors to <code>a %*% x = b</code> is equivalent to the problem of finding integer solutions to <code>h %*% y = b</code>, where <code>x = u %*% y</code>. This second problem is easier, as <code>h</code> is lower diagonal- so solving this system is just a matter of “back filling”.</p>
<p>Let’s first find <code>h, u</code>.</p>

<p>So in our case: all integer solutions of <code>a %*% x = b</code> are of the form <code>[500, -800, 400] + k * [-3, 5, -2]</code> for integer <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>Now we just need to pick <code>k</code> to make everything non-negative (an implicit puzzle condition!). The sign changes of entries of <code>[500, -800, 400] + k * [-3, 5, -2]</code> happen for <code>k</code> where one of the coordinates is equal to zero. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>500 - 3 * k == 0</code></li>
<li><code>-800 + 5 * k == 0</code>, and</li>
<li><code>400 - 2 * k == 0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the <code>k</code> of interest are in the range <code>ceiling(max(0, 800/5)) &lt;= k &lt;= floor(min(500/3, 400/2))</code>, or <code>160 &lt;= k &lt;= 166</code>. This gives us:</p>

<p>I was browsing the December, 1908 issue of <em>The Strand Magazine</em> (it’s related to a hobby of mine), when I came across an article called “The World’s Best Puzzles”, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dudeney">Henry Dudeney</a>, who seems to have been the Martin Gardner of his day. Here’s a cool puzzle from that article, which according to Dudeney was first recorded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcuin">Alcuin</a>, Abbot of Canterbury (735-804). I assume it’s from his manuscript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositiones_ad_Acuendos_Juvenes"><em>Propositiones ad Acutendos Juvenes</em></a> (Problems to Sharpen Youths).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>100 bushes of corn are distributed to 100 people such that every man receives 3 bushels, every woman 2 bushels, and every child 1/2 a bushel. How many men, women, and children are there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are seven solutions; Dudeney gives one: 20 men, 0 women, and 80 children. Can you find the other six?</p>
<p>Let’s put the puzzle into algebra, so it’s easier to discuss.</p>

<section id="the-solution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Here’s my solution. I’ll break it into steps. From the problem statement, we know <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> are all nonnegative integers.</p>
<p><strong>1. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> is even.</strong></p>
<p>That there is an even number of children is obvious from the fact that the total number of bushels is integral, and that the number of men, women, and children all have to be integral.</p>
<p><strong>2. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> is a multiple of 5.</strong></p>
<p>To prove this, we take the two original equations and eliminate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m">, by multiplying the first equation by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-3"> and adding the two together.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A-3m%20&amp;-%203w%20&amp;-%203c%20&amp;=%20-300%20%5C%5C%0A3m%20&amp;+%202w%20&amp;+%200.5c%20&amp;=%20100%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A"></p>
<p>this gives us:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A-w%20&amp;%20-2.5c%20&amp;=%20-200%20%5C%5C%0Aw%20&amp;+%202.5c%20&amp;=%20200%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Another way to write the last equation is</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Aw%20+%20(5/2)%20c%20=%20200%0A"></p>
<p>Since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> is even, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(5/2)%20c"> is divisible by 5, and 200 is divisible by 5; therefore, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> is divisible by 5. <strong>QED</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%20%5Cleq%2030"></strong></p>
<p>To prove this, let’s eliminate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c">.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A-0.5m%20&amp;-%200.5w%20&amp;-0.5c%20&amp;=%20-50%5C%5C%0A%20%20%203m%20&amp;+%202w%20%20%20&amp;+%200.5c%20&amp;=%20100%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%20%20%20%0A"></p>
<p>this results in:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A2.5m%20&amp;+%201.5w%20&amp;+%200%20%20%20&amp;=%2050%20%5C%5C%0A%20%20%205m%20&amp;+%20%20%203w%20&amp;+%200%20%20%20&amp;=%20100%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A"></p>
<p>which gives us</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Am%20=%2020%20-%20(3/5)%20w%0A"></p>
<p>Now we apply the fact that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m%20%5Cgeq%200">:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%0A20%20-%20(3/5)%20w%20&amp;%5Cgeq%200%20%5C%5C%0A(3/5)%20w%20&amp;%5Cleq20%20%5C%5C%0A3%20w%20%20&amp;%5Cleq100%20%5C%5C%0Aw%20&amp;%5Cleq%20100/3%20=%2033.333...%0A%5Cend%7Baligned%7D%0A"></p>
<p>And since we know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w"> must be a multiple of 5, this gives us <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?w%20%5Cleq%2030">. <strong>QED</strong></p>
<p>What are the multiples of 5 that are less than or equal to 30?</p>

  <title>Manifold Learning</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Many algorithms supporting AI and machine learning depend on the notion of <em>embeddings</em>. Data sets are mapped to or embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean vector spaces. Then, various mathematical strategies are employed to reduce data size by mapping these high dimensional points to structures in lower dimensional spaces in ways that preserve some important structural properties of the high dimensional data. Classic examples are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a> algorithm which maps similar words to nearby points in vector spaces, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Components Analysis</a> which maps multidimensional vector data to lower dimensional spaces while preserving the variance of the data points. The mathematical term for the structures sought to contain the data in the lower dimensional space is <em>manifold</em>. Manifolds are basically vector spaces with additional structure that enable notions such as connectedness and smoothness to make sense. Think of a sphere as a two-dimensional manifold in a three-dimensional space, or lines and circles as one-dimensional structures in a two-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Over the past fifteen years or so, these kinds of geometric ideas about working with data have coalesced into the very mathematical field of <em>Manifold Learning</em>. In this post, I hope to provide a way for those of us who are not mathematicians, but willing to do some work to explore this incredibly interesting field. I’ll do this by pointing to some of the accessible literature, providing a couple of simple examples, and listing some R resources for exploration.</p>
<section id="an-overview-of-manifold-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-overview-of-manifold-learning">An overview of Manifold Learning</h2>
<p>This section comprises some notes on the marvelous review paper <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040522-115238?crawler=true#right-ref-B71">Manifold Learning: What, How, and Why</a> by Marina Meilă and Hanyu Zhang. The paper is a comprehensive, clearly written, historical approach at a level suitable for beginners. It is an expert guide to the vast literature on the subject. The Annual Reviews version of the paper at the link above is a pleasure to work with because almost all of the essential papers are hyperlinked.</p>

<section id="the-basic-problem" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-basic-problem">The Basic Problem</h3>
<p>The basic problem motivating manifold learning is data reduction. Given a data set with D features or explanatory variables, how can we transform it into a smaller data set with fewer features in a way that retains all of the essential information and provides some insight about the structure of the data? The idea is similar to PCA. Here, we assume the data exist in a D-dimensional vector space but mostly lie in or near a k-dimensional subspace. PCA provides a linear mapping from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5ED"> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5Ek">.</p>

There are three basic approaches to manifold learning: Locally linear approximations, Principal Curves and Surfaces, and Embeddings.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embeddings">Embeddings</h3>
<p>Meilă and Zhang propose a provisional taxonomy of embedding algorithms, which they concede is superficial but which adequately characterizes the state of the art. All approaches begin with information about the data summarized in a weighted neighborhood graph. An embedding algorithm then produces a smooth mapping that is designed to distort the neighborhood information as little as possible. The algorithms differ in their choice of information they preserve and in the constraints on smoothness. The fundamental categories of embedding algorithms are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“One-shot” algorithms that derive embedding coordinates from principal eigenvectors of a matrix associated with the neighborhood graph of a data set or by solving an optimization problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Attraction-repulsion algorithms that proceed from an initial embedding, often produced by iterative improvements of a one-shot algorithm.</p></li>

<section id="sne-and-t-sne" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sne-and-t-sne">SNE and t-SNE</h3>
<p>This section briefly describes the SNE algorithm and its improved variation t-SNE, which were designed to visualize high dimensional data to a two or three-dimensional space.</p>
<section id="sne" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sne">SNE</h4>
<p>The intuition behind Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE), described in the paper by <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2002/file/6150ccc6069bea6b5716254057a194ef-Paper.pdf">Hinton &amp; Roweis (2002)</a>, is to emphasize local distances and employ a cost function that enforces both keeping the images of nearby objects nearby and keeping the images of widely separated objects relatively far apart.</p>
<p>Most embedding methods require each high-dimensional data point to be associated with only a single location in the low-dimensional space, making it difficult to unfold “many-to-one” mappings in which a single ambiguous object really belongs in several disparate locations in the low-dimensional space. SNE tries to place high-dimensional data points in a low-dimensional space so as to optimally preserve neighborhood identity and allow multiple different low-dimensional images. For example, because of its probabilistic formulation, SNE has the ability to be extended to mixtures in which ambiguous high-dimensional objects such as the word “bank” can be associated with several widely-separated images (e.g., both “river” and “finance”) in the low-dimensional space.</p>
<p>The basic idea underlying SNE is to construct a Gaussian probability distribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_i"> over each point, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i">, in the high dimensional space that describes the conditional probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_%7Bj%7Ci%7D"> that i would pick j as its neighbor. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_%7Bj%7Ci%7D%20=%20%20exp(-%5C%7C%20x_i%20-%20x_j%5C%7C%5E2/2%5Csigma_i%5E2)%20%5Csum_%7Bk%20%5Cneq%20i%7D%20exp(-%5C%7C%20x_i%20-%20x_k%5C%7C%5E2%20/%202%5Csigma_i%5E2)"></p>
<p>Then, find a similar distribution, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Q_i">, over the points in the points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> in the low dimensional space to which the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_i"> are mapped. If, for all i, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_%7Bi%7Cj%7D=q_%7Bi%7Cj%7D">, then the similarities will be preserved. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7By_i%7D"> points are found by using gradient descent to minimize the sum of all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Liebler</a> divergences using the cost function: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20=%20%5Csum_i%20KL(P_i%20%5C%7C%20Q_i)%20=%20%5Csum_i%20%5Csum_j%20p_%7Bj%7Ci%7Dlog(p_%7Bj%7Ci%7D/q_%7Bj%7Ci)%7D"></p>
<p>In the high dimensional space, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i"> values are selected by performing a binary search for the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i"> that produces a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_i"> with a fixed perplexity specified by the user. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?Perp(P_i)%20=%202%5E%7BH(P_i)%7D"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7BH(P_i)%7D%20=%20-%5Csum_j%20p_%7Bj%7Ci%7Dlog_2%20p_%7Bj%7Ci%7D"> is the Shannon entropy measured in bits. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_i"> for the low dimensional space are set to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/%5Csqrt2">.</p>
</section>
<section id="t-sne" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="t-sne">t-SNE</h4>
<p>The t-SNE algorithm, described in <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf?fbcl">van der Maaten and Hinton (2008)</a>, is an improvement on SNE that overcomes several technical difficulties. The main differences from SNE are that (1) t-SNE uses a symmetric version of the cost function, which has a simpler gradient, and (2) t-SNE uses a t-distribution with one degree of freedom for the points in the low dimensional space. These help overcome optimization problems and mitigate the effect of the <em>Crowding Problem</em> in which the area available in the low dimensional map to accommodate moderately distant data points will not be sufficient.</p>
<p>Van der Maaten and Hinton point out that in both SNE and t-SNE,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…the gradient may be interpreted as the resultant force created by a set of springs between the map points <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_j"> . . . The spring between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_i"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y_j"> repels or attracts the map points depending on whether distance between the two in the map is too small or too large to represent the similarities between the two high dimensional points.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final result, t-SNE, is an algorithm that preserves local similarities between points while preserving enough of the global structure to recognize clusters. The art of both these algorithms comprises not only marshaling appropriate mathematics to realize intuitive geometric ideas about data relationships, but also in working through the many technical difficulties and optimization problems to provide reasonable performance.</p>

<p>The following is a short list of R packages that may be helpful for Manifold Learning.</p>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cml">cml</a> vo.2.2: Finds a low-dimensional embedding of high-dimensional data, conditioning on available manifold information. The current version supports conditional MDS (based on either conditional SMACOF in Bui (2021) or closed-form solution in Bui (2022) and conditional ISOMAP in Bui (2021).</p>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dyndimred">dyndimred</a> v1.0.4: Provides a common interface for applying dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (‘PCA’), Independent Component Analysis (‘ICA’), diffusion maps, Locally-Linear Embedding (‘LLE’), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (‘t-SNE’), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (‘UMAP’). Has built-in support for sparse matrices.</p>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hydra">hydra</a> v0.1.0: Calculate an optimal embedding of a set of data points into low-dimensional hyperbolic space. This uses the strain-minimizing hyperbolic embedding of Keller-Ressel and Nargang (2019).</p>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=matrixLaplacian">matrixLaplacian</a> v1.0: Constructs the normalized Laplacian matrix of a square matrix, returns the eigenvectors (singular vectors) and visualization of normalized Laplacian map.</p>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=phateR">phateR</a> v1.0.7: Implements a novel conceptual framework for learning and visualizing the manifold inherent to biological systems in which smooth transitions mark the progressions of cells from one state to another.</p>
<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Riemann">Riemann</a> v0.1.4: provides a variety of algorithms for manifold-valued data, including Fréchet summaries, hypothesis testing, clustering, visualization, and other learning tasks.

<p>This is a heartfelt welcome to all members of the R community, from long-time readers of <a href="https://rviews.rstudio.com/">R Views</a> to those just joining us. For years, R Views served as a source of resources, insights, and inspiration for R users. We are delighted to bring those ambitions to a new, Quarto-powered technical blog. Our goal is that R Works becomes a hub for news, opinions, and stories as the landscape of R continues to grow and evolve.</p>
<p>R is more than code, it’s also the people behind it. We hope this blog reflects diverse perspectives and experiences from across the community. To that end, we invite your voices to help shape this space together. If you have unique perspectives, updates, commentary, or examples of using R that you’d love to share, we want to hear from you.
